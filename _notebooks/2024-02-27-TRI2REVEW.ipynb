    "\n",
    "Spotify: We recreated spotify and included features like a login page, playing songs, creating playlists, and having unique animations with the frontend design. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My Role: I worked on the feature playing the songs. By developing the structure of the songs database, I was able to get the song links to work properly and fetched them onto the frontend using their respective ID's. By developing the second half of the songs api, which was the /api/songs/[id] page we were able to individually grab the songs ID and play them when needed. Finally, on the individual songs pages, I grabbed the individual data of the song, and used it to create a play button that plays or stops the song depending on the user. \n",

    "- [ ] Instructions for input from one of the following:\n",

    "\n",
    "This meets the criteria for instructions for input from the user. It includes a form element with input fields for the username and password, prompting the user to enter their credentials. The onsubmit attribute of the form element calls the login_user function when the form is submitted, indicating user actions that trigger events. This setup allows the user to input their username and password directly into the form fields, fulfilling the requirement for input instructions from the user.\n",

    "- [ ] Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the program’s purpose\n",
    "IMPORTANT: The data abstraction must make the program easier to develop (alternatives would be more complex) or easier to maintain (future changes to the size of the list would otherwise require significant modifications to the program code).\n",

    "\n",
    "The code utilizes a list to represent a collection of data, such as storing user input or maintaining a database of items. By using a list, the program efficiently manages the complexity of handling multiple pieces of related information. For instance, we are using a list to fill out the information of each song, including the name, URL, artist, and URI. This approach not only helps in organizing data but also facilitates easy retrieval and manipulation, contributing to fulfilling the program's purpose effectively. This list is then sent to the SQlite database which can be accessed in the frontend by GET methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] At least one procedure that contributes to the program’s intended purpose, where you have defined:\n",

    "\n",
    "This code implements a Flask API for managing songs, providing endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting songs. The `create_song` method within the `SongAPI` class handles the creation of new songs by extracting data from the JSON payload of incoming requests and adding them to the database. It adheres to the specified requirement by encapsulating the procedure for creating songs within a clearly defined method, accepting no explicit parameters but accessing data from the request payload. Upon successful creation, the method returns a JSON response containing the newly created song's data along with an HTTP status code indicating success.\n",

    "\n",
    "This segment of code meets the criteria by orchestrating a sequence of operations to update a song object based on provided arguments. Through conditional statements, it selectively updates the attributes of the song object, ensuring that only relevant changes are made. By iterating over the request arguments, it dynamically handles potential updates, allowing for a flexible and adaptable approach. Overall, this process exemplifies the essential programming concepts of sequencing, selection, and iteration within the context of updating song data in a RESTful API."

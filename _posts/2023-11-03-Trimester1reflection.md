## Trimester 1 Reflection
- The student team teaches that we had every week allowed me to learn about the basic of computer science principles 
- I was able to learn how to apply the new content and be able to incorporate it into our passion project 
- When watching the college board videos, I was able to properly understand the content and its applications
- One learning from trimester 1 was watching the college board videos and understanding the basis and foundations of sequential searches and how it is implemented into most projects
- Being able to properly understand if and then and else statements was the most effective takeaway as it is being almost always apparent in any code snippets
- I am proud of my student respository as I was able to learn how to implement and organize the content I have learned in a way fully demonstrate my accomplishments

- One learning from trimester 1 was watching the college board videos and understanding the basis and foundations of sequential searches and how it is implemented into most projects
- Being able to properly understand if and then and else statements was the most effective takeaway as it is being almost always apparent in any code snippets
- I am proud of my student respository as I was able to learn how to implement and organize the content I have learned in a way fully demonstrate my accomplishments

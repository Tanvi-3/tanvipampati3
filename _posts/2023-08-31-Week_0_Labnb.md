### Description
- Installed all necessary tools and equipment needed
- Created a student repositiory and became familiar with VS Code

### Problems Faced
- I was in conda which gave me a hard time to use the command code, so I deactivated conda to be able to continue
- I did version checks and my python was not up to date, so I had to reinstall to have the correct version

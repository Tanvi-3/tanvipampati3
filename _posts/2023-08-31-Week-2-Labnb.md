### Description
- Made Lab Notebook and was able to make the table set up
- Made Snake Game
- Made Calculator
- Cloned new student repository and have one 1 menu called CompSci 


### Problems Faced
- Due to me creating a new repository earlier, I didn't have access to the calculator markdown file, so I had to copy the assets from the teacher's repository
- When I was trying to create the Lab Notebook, all my files in my VS code disapeared so I was able to create a repository with the commits I made to github to restore all my files
